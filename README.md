# NFT-Preview-Card
It is my first source code upload so please be gentle with me and if you feel like anything needs change or could be done in a more organized or quick way please suggest to me the changes I should make to make it more effective. 
This is a website I created using HTML and CSS a very simple webpage for a preview card. The CSS part was done with SASS. 
It is made with mobile first layout.
The challenge was from Frontend Mentor.
